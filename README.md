Had difficulty Scaling the Time, but I was able to learn that date objects work better with milliseconds over seconds, and was able to generate to correct times.

I also learned how to better work with the `.on('event', function(event, datum))`. I didn't know the function takes two parameters, which makes my life a lot easier when trying to acess the information.

I also learned about the `selection.html()` which I used over the `selection.text()` in the tooltip.
